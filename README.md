I made an Empty MVC project for 8 week Home work.
## Overview of ASP.NET Core MVC Architecture


### **Model**
Manages data operations and handles access to the database.

### **View**
Contains the user interface and the visualized data.

### **Controller**
Acts as a bridge between the Model and View layers; it handles business logic and processes incoming requests.

### **builder.Build()** and **app.Run()**

1. **builder.Build()**: Indicates that all services and configurations of the application have been completed, and the application is ready to be executed.

2. **app.Run()**: Starts the application and begins listening for HTTP requests. This marks the beginning of the application's lifecycle.
